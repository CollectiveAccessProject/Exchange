# Exchange
A digital platform for creating, sharing and reusing learning resources â€“ collections of assets sources from a multitude of sources

## Pre-Setup

Before you fire up the app, make sure you have [ElasticSearch](https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch) up+running, because we rely on it for search indexing.
On a Mac with [homebrew](http://brew.sh/) installed, you could simply do this:

    brew install elasticsearch
    elasticsearch --config=/usr/local/opt/elasticsearch/config/elasticsearch.yml
    
This is going to block your Terminal with the ElasticSearch process until you kill it with Ctrl-C.
